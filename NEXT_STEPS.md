# Next Steps for NNA Registry Frontend

This document outlines the next steps needed to complete the deployment of the NNA Registry Frontend.

## 1. Dependency Resolution

The project currently has some dependency issues that need to be resolved:

1. There are compatibility issues between React 19 and Material UI 5.x. 
   Possible solutions:
   - Downgrade React to version 18.x
   - Use Material UI 7.x (newer version compatible with React 19)
   - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when installing packages

To fix:
```bash
# Option 1: Downgrade React
npm uninstall react react-dom
npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0

# Option 2: Use newer Material UI (if available)
npm install @mui/material@latest @mui/icons-material@latest

# Option 3: Force install with legacy peer deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. There are TypeScript type issues with Material UI components:
   - Update component usage to match the latest Material UI API
   - Fix Grid components to use the correct prop structure
   - Address other component issues (ListItem, etc.)

## 2. Build and Test the Frontend

Once dependencies are resolved:

1. Build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

2. Test the production build locally:
```bash
npx serve -s build
```

3. Verify functionality, especially:
   - Authentication flow
   - Asset registration
   - Asset search and browse
   - Taxonomy browsing

## 3. Set Up API Connection

1. Configure environment variables for API connection:
   - Create `.env.local` file with proper `REACT_APP_API_URL` pointing to your backend
   - For production, edit `.env.production` with the deployed backend URL

2. Test API connectivity:
   - Verify login/register work correctly
   - Check asset creation and retrieval
   - Ensure taxonomy data loads correctly

## 4. Deploy to GitHub and Hosting Service

1. Follow the steps in GITHUB_INSTRUCTIONS.md to push to GitHub

2. Choose a hosting service:
   - Netlify or Vercel (recommended for easy deployment)
   - Google Cloud Storage with Cloud CDN
   - Traditional web hosting

3. Configure CI/CD:
   - Set up GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure environment variables in the hosting service
   - Set up automated deployments for main branch

## 5. Post-Deployment Steps

1. Configure custom domain (if applicable)

2. Set up monitoring:
   - Google Analytics or similar
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring

3. Documentation updates:
   - Ensure README is up to date
   - Document any environment-specific configurations

## 6. Future Enhancements

1. Performance optimizations:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add service workers for offline capabilities

2. Feature enhancements:
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Batch operations for assets
   - User management for admins

3. UI/UX improvements:
   - More responsive design optimizations
   - Enhanced accessibility
   - Dark mode support
